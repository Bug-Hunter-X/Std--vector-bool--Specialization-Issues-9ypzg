# std::vector<bool> Specialization Issues in C++

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, issue related to the specialization of `std::vector<bool>` in C++.  The standard library's implementation of `std::vector<bool>` differs from the typical `std::vector` implementation, and this can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when accessing elements using the `[]` operator.

The provided code examples showcase the problem and propose a solution to mitigate it.

## Problem

The `std::vector<bool>` specialization is optimized for memory efficiency. However, this optimization can introduce complexities that lead to subtle bugs.  The standard doesn't guarantee that `operator[]` returns a reference to a `bool` value; it might return a proxy object. This means simple assignments might not behave as intuitively expected.
